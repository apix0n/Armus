## 🎨 How to add a character

**Example with the character:** "termius"

* Open `/db.json`
  
* Gather the following informations:
  * The character's name **(required)**,
  * The artist's ID (if you don't know what I'm talking about, check "How to add an artist" below "How to add a character") **(required)**,
  * The image of the character **(required)**,
  * The date when the artist drew the character ***or*** when you're adding it **(required)**,
  * The GitHub "AddCharacter" issue number,
  * The GitHub "Idea" issue number,
  
* Find the place where the character will be (the characters need to be sorted alphabetically).
  > Here, the character's name is "termius", so it will be placed between "tchoupius" and "tetrus".
```json
"characters": [
    ...
  },
  {
    "name": "talecramptus",
    "artist": "Kooki",
    "image": "../pics/talecramptus.jpeg",
    "date": "04/07/2023"
  },
  {
    "name": "tchoupius",
    "artist": "Aliko",
    "image": "../pics/tchoupius.jpeg",
    "date": "29/06/2022"
  },
  // INDICATION: This is where the character will be placed. 
  {
    "name": "tetrus",
    "artist": "Kooki",
    "image": "../pics/tetrus.jpeg",
    "date": "05/04/2023"
  },
  {
    "name": "the-creatorus",
    "artist": "Chus",
    "image": "../pics/the-creatorus.jpeg",
    "date": "20/06/2022"
  },
  {
    ...
]
```
  
* Add the character in the right place to `db.json`.
```json
"characters": [
    ...
  },
  {
    "name": "talecramptus",
    "artist": "Kooki",
    "image": "../pics/talecramptus.jpeg",
    "date": "04/07/2023"
  },
  {
    "name": "tchoupius",
    "artist": "Aliko",
    "image": "../pics/tchoupius.jpeg",
    "date": "29/06/2022"
  },
  // INDICATION: These are the lines you are adding.
  {
    "name": "termius",  // Replace "termius" by the name of the character
    "artist": "Apix",   // Replace "Apix" by the ArtistID 
    "image": "../pics/termius.jpeg", // Replace by the path of the image
    "date": "04/07/2023" // Replace by the date when the artist drew the character or when you're adding it
  }, 
  // INDICATION: Don't forget to add the comma after the ending bracket.
  {
    "name": "tetrus",
    "artist": "Kooki",
    "image": "../pics/tetrus.jpeg",
    "date": "05/04/2023"
  },
  {
    "name": "the-creatorus",
    "artist": "Chus",
    "image": "../pics/the-creatorus.jpeg",
    "date": "20/06/2022"
  },
  {
    ...
]
```

## ✉ How to add an artist

**Example with the artist:** "EL MALADO"

* Open `/db.json`.

* Find the place where the artist should be (the artists are not sorted, add the artist after the last one).
```json
"artists": [
  ...
  },
  {
    "id": "Jiwon",
    "prettyname": "Jiwon",
    "rank": 0
  },
  {
    "id": "GaimeLeZuitres",
    "prettyname": "GaimeLéZuitres",
    "rank": 0
  } // INDICATION: The artist will be added after this bracket.
],
  ...
```

* Place the artist:
```json
"artists": [
  ...
  },
  {
    "id": "Jiwon",
    "prettyname": "Jiwon",
    "rank": 0
  },
  {
    "id": "GaimeLeZuitres",
    "prettyname": "GaimeLéZuitres",
    "rank": 0
  }, // INDICATION: Don't forget to add the comma after the ending bracket.
  { // INDICATION: These are the lines you are adding.
    "id": "EL-MALADO", // This is the ArtistID. Repalce it by a string which doesn't have special characters nor spaces (only hyphens are allowed).
    "prettyname": "EL MALADO", // Replace this by the name that will be shown on the website.
    "rank": 0 // This is the rank of the artist. See "Artist ranks" below for more informations.
  }
],
  ...
```

* Save your changes.

* Verify that `/db.json` is valid using https://jsonlint.com.
